NB: this last line from the blog: 

"Considering that it took only around six months to add RISC-V support to Native Image using the LLVM backend, the idea to add support for other potential targets such as WEBASSEMBLY is appealing. In fact, adding other architectures will become even more accessible, as the LLVM backend will soon emit the Native Image data section itself, allowing it to skip adding information about object files."
